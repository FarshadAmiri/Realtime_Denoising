Done:

* online-offline status of users should be update in real-time

* when user is not streaming, shouldn't show start listening for the other users.

* in friends section, when a friend name appears it should says already friend.
+ if request sent but the other user has not yet accepted, show request sent.
+ if the other user has rejected, the request is dismissed so it should show 
option of sending friend request.

* you should be able to undo a friend request before the other user action (accept or reject).

* user cannot not be able to abandon its page and open up his friends pages when streaming.

* stop listening when user changes the page (goes to one of his friends pages).

* when stream finishes, "Audio stream finished" appears for listeners and listening stops.
+ new saved audio should appear for them in saved audios when it is ready (so no need to refresh the page).
