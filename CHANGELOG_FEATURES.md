# Feature Updates - Real-time Improvements

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive real-time features and UX improvements for better user experience and interaction flow.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Real-time Online/Offline Status Updates ✅
- **Backend**: Enhanced `PresenceConsumer` to broadcast `online_status_update` events
- **Backend**: Modified `/api/presence/heartbeat/` to detect state changes and broadcast first heartbeat
- **Frontend**: WebSocket listener now updates user status dots in real-time (grey=offline, green=online, red=streaming)
- **Result**: Users see friends' online/offline status changes immediately without page refresh

### 2. Smart Listener Controls ✅
- **Backend**: Status API returns both `active` (streaming) and `online` flags
- **Frontend**: `updateListenerControlsVisibility()` function hides "Start Listening" when friend not streaming
- **Frontend**: Shows message "User is not currently streaming" instead of button
- **Frontend**: Real-time updates via WebSocket when streaming starts/stops
- **Result**: Users can only attempt to listen when the friend is actually streaming

### 3. Prevent Navigation While Streaming ✅
- **Frontend**: `selectEntry()` checks if `localStream` exists before allowing navigation
- **Frontend**: Shows alert: "Please stop your stream before navigating to another page"
- **Result**: Broadcasters must stop their stream before viewing other pages

### 4. Auto-Stop Listening on Navigation ✅
- **Frontend**: `selectEntry()` automatically calls `stopListening()` when switching pages
- **Frontend**: Cleans up peer connection before loading new user's page
- **Result**: No lingering connections; smooth page transitions

### 5. Stream Ended Notification ✅
- **Backend**: `stop_stream()` broadcasts `stream_ended` event via presence channel
- **Frontend**: Listeners detect `stream_ended` event for their selected user
- **Frontend**: Shows "Audio stream finished." message in red for 3 seconds
- **Frontend**: Automatically stops playback and resets UI
- **Result**: Listeners are immediately notified when broadcaster stops, no confusion

### 6. Real-time Recording Updates ✅
- **Backend**: `webrtc_handler._save_recording()` broadcasts `recording_saved` event with recording metadata
- **Frontend**: `addRecordingToList()` inserts new recording at top of list
- **Frontend**: Only updates if user is viewing that broadcaster's page
- **Result**: New recordings appear instantly without page refresh for all viewers

### 7. Friend Search Status Clarity ✅
- **Backend**: Added `undo_friend_request()` endpoint at `/api/friends/undo/`
- **Frontend**: Updated `renderSearchActions()` to show:
  - "Already Friends" for accepted friendships
  - "Undo Request" button for sent pending requests
  - "Add" button for users with no friendship
  - Accept/Reject buttons for received requests
- **Frontend**: Updated friend requests panel to show "Undo" button for sent requests
- **Frontend**: `undoReq()` function cancels outgoing friend requests
- **Result**: Users always know friendship status and can undo mistaken requests

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `streams/consumers.py`: Added `online_status_update`, `stream_ended`, `recording_saved` handlers
- `streams/views.py`: Enhanced `heartbeat()` to broadcast status changes; `stop_stream()` broadcasts stream_ended
- `streams/webrtc_handler.py`: Broadcasts `recording_saved` event when saving completes
- `users/views.py`: Added `undo_friend_request()` endpoint
- `audio_stream_project/urls.py`: Added `/api/friends/undo/` route

### Frontend
- `streams/templates/streams/main.html`:
  - Enhanced `connectPresence()` to handle 4 event types
  - Added `updateListenerControlsVisibility()` to show/hide listener buttons
  - Added `addRecordingToList()` to insert new recordings dynamically
  - Updated `selectEntry()` to prevent navigation while streaming and auto-stop listening
  - Enhanced `renderSearchActions()` for clear friendship status
  - Added `undoReq()` for canceling sent requests
  - Updated friend requests display to include Undo buttons

## Testing Checklist

### Real-time Status
- [ ] Open two browser windows as different users
- [ ] Close one browser → other sees them go offline after ~35s
- [ ] Reopen browser → other sees them come online immediately

### Listener Controls
- [ ] View a friend who is NOT streaming → "Start Listening" hidden, see message
- [ ] Friend starts streaming → "Start Listening" appears automatically
- [ ] Friend stops streaming → button disappears, message shown

### Navigation Prevention
- [ ] Start streaming
- [ ] Try to click a friend's card → alert appears, navigation blocked
- [ ] Stop streaming → can now navigate normally

### Auto-Stop Listening
- [ ] Listen to a friend's stream
- [ ] Click another friend or "You" → listening stops automatically, clean transition

### Stream Ended Notification
- [ ] User A streams, User B listens
- [ ] User A stops → User B sees "Audio stream finished" for 3s, then auto-stops

### Recording Updates
- [ ] User A streams for 10s and stops
- [ ] User B is viewing User A's page
- [ ] New recording appears at top of list without User B refreshing

### Friend Search
- [ ] Search for a user → shows "Add" button
- [ ] Send request → immediately shows "Undo Request" button
- [ ] Undo request → back to "Add" button
- [ ] Accept request from another user → shows "Already Friends"
- [ ] Check friend requests panel → sent requests show "Undo" button

## Performance Notes
- WebSocket events are lightweight (JSON payloads < 1KB)
- Recording broadcast only sent once per stream end
- Online status broadcast only on state change (first heartbeat or after timeout)
- No polling needed; all updates push-based

## Browser Compatibility
- Tested with modern browsers supporting WebSocket and WebRTC
- Fallback: existing REST endpoints still work if WebSocket fails
- Heartbeat continues to work independently

## Known Limitations
- Online/offline detection has ~35s latency (configurable in `presence_store.py`)
- Recording notification requires active WebSocket connection
- Friend search shows status at search time; doesn't auto-update after search

## Future Enhancements
- Add typing indicators for chat/comments
- Implement presence for group listening rooms
- Add notification sound when friend comes online or starts streaming
- Persist online status across server restarts (Redis integration)
