# Streaming Fixes Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all changes made to fix the real-time streaming functionality issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Timer Not Working (Stayed at 00:00) ✅
**Problem:** The stream duration timer was not updating and stayed at 00:00.

**Solution:**
- Added element reference checks in `startStreamTimer()` and `updateStreamDuration()`
- Added debug logging to track timer updates
- Ensured `streamDurationEl` is always found even if initially null

**Files Modified:**
- `static/js/main.js`: Enhanced timer functions with proper element checking

### 2. No Cleanup on Page Reload/Disconnect ✅
**Problem:** Streams continued server-side when users reloaded or closed the page.

**Solution:**
- Added `beforeunload` event handler that uses `navigator.sendBeacon` API
- Implemented WebSocket disconnect cleanup in `PresenceConsumer`
- Added `cleanup_user_stream()` method to stop streaming sessions when WebSocket disconnects

**Files Modified:**
- `static/js/main.js`: Added `handlePageUnload()` function and event listener
- `streams/consumers.py`: Added disconnect cleanup logic

### 3. No Audio Recording/Saving ✅
**Problem:** Denoised audio was not being saved to files.

**Solution:**
- Implemented audio frame buffering in `WebRTCSession`
- Created `_save_recording()` method that:
  - Concatenates all denoised audio frames
  - Saves to `streamed_audios/` directory as WAV files
  - Creates `StreamRecording` database entries
  - Copies files to media directory for web access
- Added `soundfile` dependency for audio file writing

**Files Modified:**
- `streams/webrtc_handler.py`: Added recording functionality
- `requirements.txt`: Added soundfile dependency

### 4. WebSocket Updates Not Fast Enough ✅
**Problem:** Streaming status badges updated slowly or not at all.

**Solution:**
- Reduced polling interval from 5s to 3s on friend pages
- Added real-time WebSocket connection to friend pages
- WebSocket now immediately updates status when friends start/stop streaming

**Files Modified:**
- `static/js/friend_page.js`: Added `initializePresenceWebSocket()` for real-time updates

### 5. Redis Logs Not Visible ✅
**Problem:** No Redis/channel layer activity was being logged.

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive logging in:
  - `streams/views.py`: Before and after channel layer sends
  - `streams/consumers.py`: When messages are received and forwarded
- All WebSocket events now log to console/Django logs

**Files Modified:**
- `streams/views.py`: Added logger.info calls
- `streams/consumers.py`: Added logger.info calls

### 6. Stream Auto-Start Issue ✅
**Problem:** Sometimes streaming would appear to start automatically on page load.

**Solution:**
- Improved `syncOwnStreamingStatus()` to:
  - Only update UI, not start WebRTC automatically
  - Add better logging to track state changes
  - Prevent false positive streaming states
- Changed initial sync to run before starting polling interval

**Files Modified:**
- `static/js/main.js`: Enhanced sync logic with better state management

## Technical Implementation Details

### Audio Recording Flow
1. **During Streaming:**
   - Each audio frame is denoised using dfn2.py/DeepFilterNet
   - Denoised frames are stored in `_recording_frames` array
   - Sample rate is captured from first frame

2. **On Stream Stop:**
   - `_save_recording()` concatenates all frames
   - Saves as WAV to `streamed_audios/{username}_{session_id}.wav`
   - Creates `StreamRecording` database entry
   - Copies to media directory for web playback

### Cleanup Strategy
1. **Page Reload/Close:**
   - `beforeunload` event → `navigator.sendBeacon` → `/api/stream/stop/`
   - Falls back to synchronous XHR if beacon fails
   - Local WebRTC connection cleaned up

2. **WebSocket Disconnect:**
   - `PresenceConsumer.disconnect()` → `cleanup_user_stream()`
   - Closes WebRTC session
   - Updates user.is_streaming flag
   - Notifies all friends via channel layer

### Real-time Status Updates
- WebSocket broadcasts to "presence" group
- All connected clients receive instant updates
- 3-second polling as backup for reliability
- Friend pages listen specifically for their viewed friend's status

## Files Modified

### JavaScript Files
1. `static/js/main.js`
   - Added beforeunload handler
   - Enhanced timer with element checks
   - Improved sync logic
   - Better logging

2. `static/js/friend_page.js`
   - Added WebSocket presence connection
   - Reduced polling interval
   - Real-time status updates

### Python Files
1. `streams/webrtc_handler.py`
   - Added audio recording buffer
   - Implemented `_save_recording()` method
   - Changed recording path to `streamed_audios/`
   - Added database record creation

2. `streams/consumers.py`
   - Added disconnect cleanup
   - Added comprehensive logging
   - Implemented `cleanup_user_stream()` method

3. `streams/views.py`
   - Added channel layer logging
   - Enhanced error messages

### Configuration Files
1. `requirements.txt`
   - Added `soundfile>=0.12.1`

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Timer Test:**
   - Start streaming
   - Verify timer updates every second
   - Check console for "[Timer] Updated duration" logs

2. **Cleanup Test:**
   - Start streaming
   - Reload page → stream should stop server-side
   - Close tab → stream should stop
   - Check logs for cleanup messages

3. **Recording Test:**
   - Stream for 10+ seconds
   - Stop streaming
   - Check `streamed_audios/` for WAV files
   - Verify recordings appear in database
   - Verify playback works on friend pages

4. **Real-time Updates Test:**
   - User A starts streaming
   - User B (friend) should see status change within 1 second
   - Stop streaming → status should update immediately

5. **Redis Test:**
   - Start streaming
   - Check Django logs for "Sending streaming_status_update via channel layer"
   - Check for "PresenceConsumer received streaming_status_update"

## Known Limitations

1. Recording quality depends on DeepFilterNet model performance
2. Large recordings may take time to save (processed in background)
3. WebSocket reconnection has 5-second delay
4. `sendBeacon` API not supported in very old browsers (fallback to XHR)

## Configuration Notes

- Recordings saved to: `{BASE_DIR}/streamed_audios/`
- Media files copied to: `{MEDIA_ROOT}/recordings/`
- WebSocket endpoint: `/ws/presence/`
- Redis/InMemory channel layers supported via `CHANNEL_BACKEND` env var

## Future Improvements

1. Add progress indicator for recording save
2. Implement recording deletion
3. Add recording title editing
4. Add recording duration limit
5. Implement audio compression (MP3/AAC)
6. Add recording thumbnails/waveforms
